# bevy_slyedoc_bvh

Credit: This is largely based on the [tutorial](https://jacco.ompf2.com/2022/04/13/how-to-build-a-bvh-part-1-basics/) series by Jacco Bikker.

## Goal

Test if I can build a simple bounding volume hierarchy in bevy and see how useful it is.

Should be possible to shot millions of rays per second.

## Notes

The examples are more used to help me test and debug at the moment.
